# Numerai

Numerai is a new kind of hedge fund that pays out a reward to data scientists that can improve their meta model.
The idea is to take a large number of uncorrelated high performing models and ensemble them.
Money is divvied out based on leaderboard ranking awarding the top 100.

I tried out an xgboost model a wide and deep model using tensorflow.  Google has used this wide and deep model to
recommend apps on the Google Play store. In this algorithm a wide linear model and a deep feed-forward neural
network are jointly trained.  This approach combines the strengths of memorization and generalization.

The xgboost model was rather poor but the tensorflow model ended up scoring the same logloss as the top 
performing models.
